Key Effects of mat-raised-button
Raised Appearance:

Shadow: Adds a shadow effect to the button, making it appear raised above the surface. This provides a 3D effect that helps the button stand out.
Elevation: The shadow effect simulates elevation. This is often used in material design to indicate clickable elements.
Background Color:

Primary and Accent Colors: When using mat-raised-button, you can specify color="primary", color="accent", or color="warn", which applies the corresponding theme color from Angular Materialâ€™s color palette.
Custom Colors: You can also apply custom background colors through CSS or inline styles if needed.
Hover and Focus Effects:

Hover: Changes the shadow intensity and/or background color when the button is hovered over.
Focus: Provides visual feedback when the button is focused, often using a focus ring or changing the shadow.
Ripple Effect:

Ink Ripple: Angular Material buttons include a ripple effect on click. This is a visual feedback that expands from the click point, providing an interactive feel.
Padding and Border Radius:

Padding: Adds padding to the button for a consistent and spacious appearance.
Border Radius:

   <button>hello</button>
	<button mat-raised-button>hello</button> //white
